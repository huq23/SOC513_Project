The crimes dataset provides data on crime rates and demographic factors for all fifty US states spanning the years 2017, 2018, and 2019, sourced from the FBIâ€™s Uniform Crime Reports (UCR)(https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/ucr ). This project exclusively examines violent crime rates. The variable description is as follows:


Violent crimes, including murder, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault, are documented per 100,000 people in each state. To compute the crime rate, the number of crimes is divided by the state's population size, ensuring fairness in comparing states regardless of their population sizes. This calculation is widely known as the crime "rate."

The ACS data folder contains information collected from the American Community Survey ( https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/ ) for the years 2017, 2018, and 2019, detailing demographic characteristics of all 50 states. This project specifically focuses on four key variables: poverty rate, unemployment rate, median income, and the percentage of the population over the age of 25 without a high school diploma.

Here's a detailed description of the variables:

percent_lhs: 
Represents the percentage of the state population over the age of 25 who do not possess a high school diploma.

median_income: 
Indicates the median household income in a state, measured in thousands of 2018 US dollars. Household income reflects the combined earnings of all members of a household, as opposed to individual incomes.

unemploy_rate: 
Refers to the unemployment rate in the state, expressed as a percentage. This rate signifies the proportion of individuals who are not currently employed but are actively seeking employment, relative to the total number of individuals in the labor force (those currently employed or actively seeking employment).

poverty_rate: 
Denotes the poverty rate in the state, also presented as a percentage. This figure represents the proportion of individuals living below the poverty line, which is a standard set by the federal government. The poverty line is adjusted annually for inflation but is often criticized for its perceived inadequacy in keeping pace with rising living costs.
